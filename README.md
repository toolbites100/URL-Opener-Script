### Steps to Create a URL Opener Online
**1. Plan the Features**

Decide on the features your tool will have. For a basic URL opener:

- A text input box where users can enter a URL.
- A button to open the URL in a new tab.
- Basic validation to check if the entered URL is valid.

**2. Write the HTML Structure**

Create a simple webpage structure with:

- A title for the tool.
- An input box for URLs.
- A button to execute the action.

**3. Add CSS for Styling**

- Style the tool to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.

**4. Write JavaScript for Functionality**

Use JavaScript to:

- Validate the URL (ensure it includes "http://" or "https://").
- Open the URL in a new browser tab.

**5. Test the Code**

- Ensure the code works as expected, allowing users to input URLs and open them in new tabs.

How to Use the Code

- Copy the code and paste it into a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
- Save the file with a .html extension (e.g., url_opener.html).
- Open the file in a web browser to test the tool.
